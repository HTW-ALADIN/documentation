# Assessment

Conceptionally an Assessment in ALADIN consists out of seperate parts. These parts are:

- Assessment Type,
- Assessment Solutions,
- Assessment Hints,
- Assessment Instructions and Assessment Design.

An Assessment Type is a composition of individual [Assessment Generator functions](../ALADIN/ALADIN.md#assessment-generator) in a set configuration. ALADIN provides a set of already defined [Assessment Generator functions](../ALADIN/ALADIN.md#assessment-generator), but also the ability to provide custom code.
